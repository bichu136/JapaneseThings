I've taken off for a run! To strengthen my feelings
When I'm worried I'll hold your hand tight

I've always betrayed my most important feelings
But yesterday I said goodbye
To risks and regrets
That I have searched over and over for excuses
I will stop letting them control me

My feet move, it can be scary at first
But all I need is a heart that wants to keep going!

I've taken off for a run! To strengthen my feelings
When I'm worried I'll hold your hand tight
You don't have to wait to be who you want to be
My dream will one day shine!

I won't fight this fight with half feelings
Not a single regret left on stage
Because when I compare my ideals and my reality
Although I have yet to reach it
I can feel the goal at the end of the road

We need hard work and perseverance, there will be sleepless nights
But it's your "I want to see your smile!" Yes, as long as everyone is here!

I'm jumping! My feelings are not a lie
The hope born from my tears
It connects me with a force that my eyes cannot see
My dream will one day shine!

I just need to close my eyes to see it again
My heart beats, I'll trust the future I believe in here
The moment the world takes on colors and shines
I want to see it with you my heart responds

I've taken off for a run! To strengthen my feelings
When I'm worried I'll hold your hand tight
You don't have to wait to be who you want to be
My dream will one day shine!

I'm jumping! My feelings are not a lie
The hope born from my tears
It connects me with a force that my eyes cannot see
My dream will one day shine!
