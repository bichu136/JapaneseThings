A heart that began to race can’t be stopped anymore

Hope and perspiration continue building up since yesterday
The tale has already begun
Once you cross over the boundary, there’s no turning back
Let’s kick the ground and drive out our weak hearts

"Since there’s already a path right before your eyes,"
That’s the only reason I need to give you a push from behind, right?(sai??? đó là động lực duy nhất bạn thúc đẩy tôi , h tôi không cần nữa??)

(can you get own best way? let’s go!)

"It’s my story!" I (want to)continue shouting this time and time again（tôi muốn nhiều lần liên tục thét lên câu này)
Let’s proceed at full speed, dragging the rest of the world along with us(đúng... )
C’mon, let’s head towards the ideal stage, let’s hasten the swelling of our hearts
Believe in the you that overcame yesterday
That’s just something that someone says, because today is what’s best(vượt qua(động từ ở câu trước) cả những lời nói của thiên hạ. Bởi vì hôm nay rất tuyệt, chỉ thế thôi.)
A heart that began to race can’t be stopped anymore

If you don’t give up, then tomorrow’s sun will surely
Shine on the puddles created today, right?

That’s right, there’s times when you’re feeling depressed too, aren’t there?
Even so, speak up as if you haven’t lost sight of yourself!

"It’s my story!" I brush away the clouds blocking my way time and time again
Let’s go full speed, dragging the rest of the world along with us
No matter how small the steps we take, we’re connected to tomorrow
Sketch out the you that crosses over today
It’s alright to let your complaints spill out just a bit to the setting sun
Since a heart that stood up won’t lose anymore

Like an olive tree, I hand over my life to the future that doesn’t say anything
Without a doubt, the today that I lived in is also someone’s tomorrow, so
We’re connected; the proof of that is surely courage and our link

(can you get own best way? let’s go!)

"It’s my story!" I continue shouting this time and time again
Let’s go full speed, dragging the rest of the world along with us
C’mon, let’s head towards the ideal stage, there’s nothing to worry about
Since the you from before today gives a reason to give you a push from behind

"It’s my story!" That’s right, it’s my own story
Since we’re going to sketch it: hope, courage, repeatedly
Even though it can’t be seen, we’re never alone
Someone believes in the you that gives it your all
No matter how far away your dreams are, it doesn’t matter because today what’s best
Let’s hasten the swelling of our hearts, and maybe someday it will reach you
A heart that began to race can’t be stopped anymore
